This repository contains a Solidity smart contract with a bug in the ownership transfer functionality and its corresponding solution. The bug allows any user to transfer contract ownership, ignoring the intended owner-only restriction. The solution addresses this by adding a check to ensure only the current owner can execute the transferOwnership function. This highlights a common security vulnerability in decentralized applications (dApps).
